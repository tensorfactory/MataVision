# MataVision (Your Affordable Edge-Based Vision Sensor)

## Overview
Supercharge your projects with MataVision, the low-cost, easy-to-use vision sensor that empowers your electronics with the power of sight.

Building on the simplicity of traditional sensors, MataVision leverages the processing capabilities of the ESP32-CAM or ESP32-S3 boards to bring computer vision to your projects at a fraction of the cost of complex camera systems.

Seamless integration, just like any other sensor, MataVision provides visual data for real-world applications.

Here's what MataVision can do for you:

Multiple Windows Image Classification: Train MataVision to recognize specific objects or scenes, ideal for applications like product sorting, state-change and anomaly detection.
Single Object Tracking: Track the movement of object in real-time, perfect for motion detection, or autonomous systems.
The possibilities are endless! Here are some inspiring applications for MataVision across various industries:

Smart Homes & Retail:
Detect an empty cat's bowl, parcels at the doorstep or door that is not fully closed.
Auto alert salesperson of customer presence or empty shelf.

Industrial Automation:
Automate quality control by training MataVision to detect mixings, wrong orientations or missing components in products.
Perform remote sensing in hazardous or cramped environments where direct-contact sensing is not possible.
Enhance safety with real-time monitoring of machinery activity.

Our user-friendly iOS app empowers you to:

Train your vision system with ease by collecting and categorizing images.
Define object boundaries using intuitive drawing tools for object detections.
Control your vision output through various methods like GPIO pins, I2C, Cloud or Display for maximum flexibility.
You can even incorporate data from other sensors via I2C or trigger a motor motion using the built-in IOs tools.

With MataVision, anyone can unlock the potential of computer vision in their projects.
